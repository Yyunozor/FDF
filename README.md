# FDF - Wireframe Model Renderer

## üìñ Introduction

Welcome to the **FDF** project! This journey into computer graphics will have you creating a program that renders 3D landscapes as wireframe models. This is a visually striking and intellectually rewarding project where you'll delve into advanced C programming, graphical rendering techniques, and algorithmic thinking.

Through the **FDF** project, you will learn to:

- Parse structured input data to represent 3D landscapes.
- Use mathematical transformations to project 3D points onto a 2D plane.
- Master the **MiniLibX** graphics library for rendering and user interaction.
- Optimize performance and implement user-friendly features.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Concepts

### 1. **Wireframe Rendering**

A wireframe model is a skeletal representation of a 3D object, consisting of points (vertices) connected by lines (edges). Key principles include:

- **3D to 2D Projection**: Using mathematical transformations to map 3D coordinates to a 2D plane while preserving perspective and relative proportions.
- **Isometric Projection**: A popular method for rendering 3D objects, maintaining equal scales along all three axes.

### 2. **MiniLibX**

**MiniLibX** is a lightweight graphics library designed for educational purposes. It simplifies the creation of graphical programs by providing:

- **Window Management**: Create and manage application windows.
- **Pixel Manipulation**: Draw individual pixels, lines, and shapes.
- **Event Handling**: Manage keyboard and mouse inputs.
- **Image Buffers**: Store and render pixel data efficiently.

### 3. **Coordinate Transformations**

Transformations are at the heart of 3D rendering. Key transformations include:

- **Translation**: Shifting an object in 3D space.
- **Rotation**: Rotating an object around the x, y, or z-axis.
- **Scaling**: Adjusting the size of an object.

The isometric projection formula:

\[ x' = x \cdot \cos(\theta) - y \cdot \sin(\theta) \]
\[ y' = (x \cdot \sin(\theta) + y \cdot \cos(\theta)) - z \]

### 4. **Event Handling and Interaction**

Your program will respond to user inputs, such as:

- **Keyboard Inputs**: For zooming, rotating, and panning.
- **Mouse Inputs** (Bonus): For intuitive interactions like dragging and zooming.
